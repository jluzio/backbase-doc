## Understand Infrastructure and Platform Services v1.12.6

Backbase Infrastructure and Platform Services (IPS) provides the secure infrastructure that connects all Backbase services.

### Edge Service
The Edge Service encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides a single entry point to the system. It handles all requests from clients and proxies. It balances these requests and routes them to the correct service. It also calls other services for request shaping and management. It takes care of authentication using the Authentication Service and the BAS Token Converter.

Functionality:
  - Routes traffic to public services.
  - Routes all friendly URL requests made to /api/ to the correct CXS or DBS service.
  - Passes a standard trace ID header to each request for each service.
  - Uses the BAS Token Converter to provide internal tokens.
  - Appends an internal token to each request if the user is authenticated.
  - Synchronizes with the Registry Service to obtain a list of accessible services.
  - Adds standard proxy headers for downstream services. The most important header is the X-Forwarded-Prefix which can be used when assembling redirect URLs.


### Authentication Service
validates user access. This is a custom service that you build using the Backbase authentication archetype.

![Request Flow](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/platform-services/1-12-6/images/puml/platform/authentication_service_flow.svg?ver=1.12.6)

You can build custom Authentication Services using Service SDK. These custom services easily integrate with Infrastructure and Platform Services.
Authentication starters:
- authentication-external-jwt-service-spring-boot-starter-parent - the Spring Boot parent starter for the Authentication Service, with support for external JWTs.
- authentication-service-spring-boot-starter-parent - the Spring Boot parent starter for the Authentication Service, without support for external JWTs.
- authentication-external-jwt-service-starter - the starter for the Authentication Service, with support for external JWTs.
You can use this starter to add the default implementation of the following endpoints to the existing service:
  - /login
  - /logout
  - /status
  - /refresh

- authentication-service-starter - a minimal Authentication Service, without support for external JWTs.


### Registry Service
The Registry Service provides service discovery. To support high availability architectures, the Registry Service enables you to register multiple server/client instances. Client services use the information that the Registry Service provides for inter-service communication and load balancing.

The Registry Service is based on Eureka, the service discovery component of Spring Cloud Netflix.


### Token Converter
![Token conversion flow](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/platform-services/1-12-6/images/puml/platform/token_converter.svg?ver=1.12.6)

#### Add user IDs from Access Control Users to internal tokens

If the Users capability is part of your environment, the system administrator can configure the token converter to get a user’s IDs from the User Manager service in Users, and add them to the internal token as follows:
- The token converter uses the external user ID in the access token to look up the user and find their internal DBS user ID and legal entity ID.
- It includes the internal user ID, legal entity ID, external user ID, and issuer ID in the following claims in the internal token: inuid (internal user id), leid (legal entity id), idp.sub (external user id), idp.iss (external issuer id)

![token](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/platform-services/1-12-6/images/puml/platform/token_converter_lookup_bas.svg?ver=1.12.6)

Adding these IDs to the internal token has the following benefits:
- Improved performance: The Access Control client does not have to call the User Manager service and convert the username into the user ID for every request that uses Access Control.

- Interoperability: Services that deal with external systems like IdPs don’t have to look up the user’s IDs. For example, when creating a confirmation for the Transaction Signing capability, the domain capability can use the information in the internal token to record the internal and external IDs of the current user in the confirmation. This enables the IdP that signs the transaction to directly compare the ID in the current external access token to the value stored in the confirmation, without further lookups.

- Reduce the need for unique usernames: When using an IdP, there is no guarantee that there is only one user with a particular username. The same username could exist in several realms or organisations. Including the IDs in the internal token reduces the need for unique usernames in such cases.

#### Caching
To improve performance, the token converter can cache the following data during the token conversion process:
- Caching conversions: To improve the performance of page loading in CXS, the token converter can cache the token conversion for a short, configurable amount of time. The default value is 3 seconds. This provides a balance between security and performance. Caching is disabled by default. However a system administrator can enable it and customize the configuration if needed.
- Caching the internal record lookup: If the token converter is configured to get the user’s IDs from the User Manager service in the Users capability, the token converter can cache the internal record lookup so that it doesn’t have to perform the lookup every time a new token is needed. The token converter can cache the user record for a configurable amount of time, that is representative of a user session, for example, 30 minutes. As this data rarely (if ever) changes, it can be cached for a longer period to improve lookup times.

Use the token converter service that is appropriate for your Backbase environment:
- BAS Token Converter - use this external token converter with custom Authentication Services built on the authentication archetype.
- Identity Token Converter - use this external token converter with Backbase Identity Services.
- Custom token converter - create a custom token converter based on the token converter starter to convert custom tokens from a third party.

Default URL: http://token-converter/convert
To override this URL, set the gateway.token.converter.url Edge Service property.


### Understand JWT claims

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) use claims to provide and transfer information between the token producer and the token consumer. Claims are statements about a user or entity. They also include additional data.

There are three types of claims:
- Registered claims - predefined claims with reserved names.
These claims are recommended but not mandatory, for example, iss (issuer) and sub (subject). For the list of registered claims, see RFC 7519.
- Public claims - claims that anyone using JWTs can define and use. To avoid collisions, define these in either:
  - The IANA JSON Web Token Registry.
  - A URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.
- Private claims - custom claims that two parties agree to use privately.

In Backbase Platform, JWTs are split into the following types. Each type has its own mandatory and optional claims.
- External tokens are used for authentication and integration with services that run externally to Edge Service.
- Internal tokens are used for communication between services within the DMZ and under the Edge Service. The Token Converter generates internal tokens from external tokens.

JWTs use these claims to transfer:
- Information you need transmit. For example, data to identify the user or entity.
- Information about the token. For example, how long it is valid for.

You can also add custom claims to external tokens or internal tokens. These are claims that you include in addition to the Backbase Platform claims. You can add a private claim to a custom application to include more information. For example, a mobileActive claim that adds more information about the user’s activity within a banking mobile app.

### About the properties files
The *.yml files contain general settings for the services. Each service has an environment entry that points to the path and file name of its properties file. The following table lists the services, the environment entry and the default file name.
